** Other platforms

This notebook can run on platforms other than Google Colab.  Comment out all the google drive parts, and edit the file manually instead of using the `%%writefile` cell magic.

If you don't have drive to save your outputs, you can use an S3 bucket on platforms that allow you to access `fusermount`.

Alternatively `tar` your output folder and send it over with `croc` or `magic-wormhole`.
