xformers support added from https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb and https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py

** Included Notebooks
*** Colab
This notebook should run effortlessly on Google Colab
*** Other platforms
A notebook without google-centric integrations has also been provided.  For platforms like *runbox*, *vast.ai*, and the like.

Feel free to open an issue if something breaks / does not work / can be improved.

** Other platforms

Comment out all the google drive parts, and edit the file manually instead of using the =%%writefile= cell magic.

If you don't have drive to save your outputs, you can use an S3 bucket on platforms that allow you to access =fusermount=.

Alternatively =tar= your output folder and send it over with =croc= or =magic-wormhole=.
